#### IDSA Guidelines[https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ482]
Empirical regimen should cover S. aureus, streptococci and gram-negative organisms. Such regimens might include a combination of vancomycin and a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin. Alternative regimens, in case of allergy or intolerance, might include a combination of daptomycin and a quinolone. The use of empiric antifungal and antimycobacterial therapy is not appropriate in most situations.

#### Norwegian Guidelines
